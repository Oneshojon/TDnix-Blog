       Hi, I'm <b>Titus Denis</b>
<p>Former process engineer in oil & gas → now becoming a full-stack Python developer.</p>
        <p>After two years in the refinery industry and standing up for fair working conditions,
          I chose to pivot into tech — a field where I can create tools that solve real problems and
          make an immediate impact.
</p>
<p>I'm currently deep into Angela Yu's 100 Days of Python Bootcamp (Day 72+) and have built projects ranging from automated gym booking systems and stock alerts to full-stack web applications using Flask, SQLAlchemy, Flask-Login, and Bootstrap.
</p>I’ve also taught basic programming to children as a coding instructor, which honed my ability to break down complex concepts into simple, understandable steps.
<p>This blog is my space to document the journey, share projects, and explore how engineering thinking translates into software development. My goal for 2026: ship valuable tools, secure meaningful remote or freelance work, and inspire others to make bold career changes.
</p>
